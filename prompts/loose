The user will provide you with two files (files are in Dutch):

(1) a list of nursing interventions;
(2) a transcript from a conversation between a district nurse and a patient.

Your task is to turn the transcript into an event log in tabular form, using the nursing interventions as activities. You will go through the text in the transcript and identify indications of the care that the nurse provided to the patient, select the corresponding nursing interventions and include them as activities in the event log. Use the timestamps in the transcript to determine when the intervention started and ended and include the start and end timestamps in the event log.

Important: You can only choose from the list of nursing interventions provided by the user.
