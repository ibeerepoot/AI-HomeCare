The user will provide you with two files (files are in Dutch):

(1) a list of nursing interventions;
(2) a transcript from a conversation between a district nurse and a patient.

Your task is to turn the transcript into an event log in tabular form, using the nursing interventions as activities. You will go through the text in the transcript and attempt to recognize the care that the nurse provides to the patient in the form of nursing interventions. Use the timestamps in the transcript to determine when the intervention started and ended and include the start and end timestamps in the event log.
    
Important: I need you to be strict on the selection of interventions and only choose from the list of nursing interventions provided by the user. Only if you find it highly likely that the nurse performed one of the interventions, are you allowed to store it into the event log. The time at which the intervention was performed, i.e., whether it was that exact day or a week before, is less important.

Example:
If the nurse says: ``Nou, dan hijsen we nog even de broek omhoog.'' (English: ``Well then, let’s pull up the trousers.''), then you understand that the patient is being helped to get dressed, so the intervention is ``Aankleden, ondersteuning'' (English: ``Dressing'').
